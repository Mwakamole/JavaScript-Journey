    <h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>
    <p>They are used to perform arithmetics on numbers</p>
    <h2>The Addition Operator(+)</h2>
    <p>
        The addition operator adds numbers.<br>
        The value displayed below is as a result of addition operration done by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p id="addition"></p>
    <h2>The Subtraction Operator(-)</h2>
    <p>
        Used to perform subtraction operations between numbers<br>
        The value displayed below is a result of subtraction.
    </p>
    <p id="subtraction"></p>
    <h2>The Multiplication Operator(*)</h2>
    <p>
        Used to perform multiplication operations between numbers<br>
        The value displayed below is a result of multiplication
    </p>
    <p id="multiplication"></p>
    <h2>The Division Operator(/)</h2>
    <p>
        Used to perform division operations between numbers<br>
        The value displayed below is a result of division
    </p>
    <p id="division"></p>
    <h2>The Modulus Operator(%)</h2>
    <p>
        Used to return the division remainder<br>
        The value displayed below is a remainder of a division operation
    </p>
    <p id="modulus"></p>
    <h2>Incrementing</h2>
    <p>
        In programming, incrementing refers to increasing the value of a variable by a certain amount,often by one.<br>
        In JavaScript it is achieved using the ++ operator.<br>
        The value displayed below has been incremented by one from its original value.
    </p>
    <p id="incrementing"></p>
    <h2>Decrementing</h2>
    <p>
        In programming, decrementing refers to decreasing the value of a variable by a certain amount,often by one.<br>
        In JavaScript it is achieved using the -- operator.<br>
        The value displayed below has been decremented by one from its original value.
    </p>
    <p id="decrementing"></p>
    <h2>The Exponentiation Operator(**)</h2>
    <p>
        The exponentiation operattor raises the first operand to the power of the second operand<br>
        The value displayed below is a result of exponentiation
    </p>
