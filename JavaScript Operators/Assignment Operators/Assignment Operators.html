    <h1>Assignment Operators</h1>
    <p>They are used to assign values to a variable</p>
    <h2>The Simple Assignment Operator(=)</h2>
    <p>
        Used to assign values to variables<br>
        The value displayed below has its value assigned by the simple assignment operator.
    </p>
    <p id="value"></p>
    <h2>The Additon Assignment Operator(+=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for adding the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of y had been set to 5, but upon the operation using the addition assignment operator, it got a new value of 8
    </p>
    <p id="additionAssignment"></p>
    <p>
        It can also be used in the addition of strings.<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of the message variable was "Hello", but using the addition assignment operator, it was set to "Hello World"
    </p>
    <p id="message"></p>
    <h2>The Subtraction Assignment Operator(-=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for subtracting the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of z had been set to 10, but upon the operation using the subtraction assignment operator, it got a new value of 5
    </p>
    <p id="subtractionAssignment"></p>
    <h2>The Multiplication Assignment Operator(*=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for multiplying the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of t had been set to 10, but upon the operation using the multiplication assignment operator, it got a new value of 50
    </p>
    <p id="multiplicationAssignment"></p>
    <h2>The Exponentiation Assignment Operator(**=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for exponentiating the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of r had been set to 2, but upon the operation using the exponentiation assignment operator, it got a new value of 8
    </p>
    <p id="exponentiationAssignment"></p>
    <h2>The Division Assignment Operator(/=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for dividing the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of g had been set to 10, but upon the operation using the division assignment operator, it got a new value of 5
    </p>
    <p id="divisionAssignment"></p>
    <h2>The Division Assignment Operator(/=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for dividing the right operand to the left operand and then assigning the result to the left operand<br>
        In the example below, the initial value of g had been set to 10, but upon the operation using the division assignment operator, it got a new value of 5
    </p>
    <p id="divisionAssignment"></p>
    <h2>The Remainder Assignment Operator(%=)</h2>
    <p>
        It is a shorthand notation for assigning a remainder to a variable<br>
        It has been used to compute the values in the example below
    </p>
